## ❓ How to Use Lucky+Roll? 

Before using, it needs to be **loaded**. There are 2 ways to do it:

1) Classic way: Clone or download the repository to your local machine, then open `index.html` in your web browser.

2) Online way: Use the GitHub Pages link which is embedded in About section.

Ok, we have loaded the app. What's next?
Here are short instructions:
- Use "+" or "-" buttons to add or remove segments. Segments are added with their names! 
When new segment is added (or removed), other segments reduce (or increase) their sizes automatically to fit the wheel.
- Click on "Name Segments" button if you want to rename segments. A modal window will appear with as many input fields as there are segments currently. Click "Save Names" to apply changes.
- Click on "Spin!" button to start the rolling. Enjoy the suspense as the wheel spins and lands on a random segment!
- App is also equipped with pointer - a red triangle at the top of the wheel. It points to the selected segment when the wheel stops spinning. Each selection creates a small modal window showing the name of the selected segment.
